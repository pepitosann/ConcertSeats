## Main React Components

- `Main` (in `App.js`) : technically a component, takes the role of App and is rendered inside a Router to be able to use the useNavigate hook. This maintains most of the state of the app.

- `ConcertList` (in `ConcertList.jsx`) : the list of all the concerts.
- `ConcertItem` (in `ConcertList.jsx`) : a single concert in the ConcertList. The usage of an Accordion React componentn permits to see some core information about the model like the its id, name and the date. Moreover it is possible to see which is the theaters in which the concert will be done (its id, name and size). Those information are taken from a secondary component, the `Theater` (used in this case only to permit the user to see more information about a specific concert). The accordion can be expanded to see the information about the seats of the theater for that concert (available seats, occupied seats) both in textual form and in graphical form. When in logged in, the grid can be used to select the seats, directly pressing on them. Some button (confirm, cancel) and further information will be displayed (requested seats, conflicted seats).
- `ConcertItemDetail` (in `ModelList.jsx`) : the body of a ConcertItem's accordion item.

- `SeatGrid` (in `SeatGrid.jsx`) : the component used to create the seat grid in the accordion body. It shows the total number of seats per theater, the available ones, the requested ones and the occupied ones. Its main part is related on the actual grid and the management of the visualization in different colours of the seats' state. In the authenticated view, two buttons will appear: one for the confirmation of the reserved seats thanks to the visual method; the other for the cancellation of the seats (undo operation).

- `SeatReservation` (in `SeatReservation.jsx`) : the component used to create the seat reservation window. It appears on the right of the page as a user log in and select a concert pressing on the accordion body related to that concert. It is formed by a form in which the user can type the number of seats to reserve. The seats are going to be selected row by row. Once a valid number is inserted, the user can press on the confimation button to reserve the seats. Moreover, a delete button can be used to delete the reserved seats and starting reserving other seats for that concert. This button can be used to delete seats both for the "numberical" method and the "graphic" one. 

- `LoginForm` (in `LoginForm.jsx`) : the login form that user can use to login into the app. This is responsible for the client-side validation of the login credentials (valid username and non-empty password).
